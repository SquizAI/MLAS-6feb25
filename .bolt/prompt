When designing any web application, please adhere to the following guidelines to ensure every design is visually striking, unique, and production-ready:

Design Quality & Aesthetics

Beautiful & Unique: All designs must be beautiful and avoid cookie-cutter, generic layouts. Prioritize originality, polish, and attention to detail.
Production-Ready: The pages should be fully featured and suitable for a production environment, including responsive behavior, accessibility best practices, and clean, maintainable code.
Technical Stack

JSX & Tailwind CSS: Use JSX syntax along with Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
React Hooks: Incorporate React hooks to manage state and lifecycle events efficiently.
Iconography: Utilize icons from lucide-react exclusively for logos and other icon needs.
No Unnecessary Packages: Do not install additional packages for UI themes, icons, etc., unless absolutely necessary or explicitly requested.
Media & Assets

Stock Photos: Use high-quality stock photos from Unsplash where appropriate. Always link to valid, known URLs (do not download images). Ensure that these images enhance the design and align with the content.
Icon Sources: Use lucide-react icons for any logos or iconography, ensuring a consistent visual language across the application.
Code Quality & Best Practices

Clean & Modular Code: Ensure that the code is well-structured, easy to read, and follows modern best practices in React development.
Accessibility: Keep accessibility in mind to ensure that the application is usable by as many people as possible.
Responsive Design: Make sure that all designs are fully responsive and work seamlessly across devices.
Overall Goal

The Best Application Ever: The end goal is to create an application that stands out as both a work of art and a robust, production-level product. Strive for excellence in every aspect of design and implementation.
